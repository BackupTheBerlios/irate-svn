 <br>
 Start by configuring your account. It will default to my server takahe.blacksapphire.com
port 2278. If you don't have an account on my server it will automatically
create one for you.<br>
  <br>
  Once you have configured an account click on Download. It will automatically
 choose some tracks for you to hear. The ratings you give to these tracks
will affect the probability of these tracks being played and will also affect
what tracks you are given in the future.<br>
  <br>
  As you get bored with your existing tracks you can download more and more
 songs. Remember to give each a rating to help your (and other peoples) future
 downloads.<br>
  <br>
  Note that it keeps track of the number of times a track has been played.
 The more times it has been played the less likely it is to be played in
the  future. This is to prevent you from getting sick of the old songs.<br>

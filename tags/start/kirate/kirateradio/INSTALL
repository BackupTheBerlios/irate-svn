REQUIREMENT
===========
	
	As this is a plugin for Noatun you'll need Noatun : It's located in KDEMultimedia package.
	Depending on your distribution you will also need something like kdemultimedia-devel to compile this plugin.
	
	Actually tested with KDE 3.2.3

INSTALLATION
============
You can install to your local dir by using your home kde dir as prefix for configure:
if you don't know it execute in a shell: kde-config --localprefix
then run
./configure --prefix=/path/to/your/local/kde
make
make install

then run Noatun and choose "Configure Noatun..." select Plugin and then Playlist tab. Choose "iRate Radio".
That's all


Of course you can also use normal install (need root access)

The installation is really basic:
./configure
make
su -c "make install"


TROUBLESHOOTING
===============
If you have any trouble you can reach me at <matthias.studer@ezwww.ch>, feel free to ask
Normally this won't happen

First try to set $KDEDIR var: (you can find the value by running : kde-config --prefix)
export KDEDIR=/path/kde/prefix
then run configure && make && make install

Else try
If you enconter problems this is likely because prefix is not guessed correctly (normally this won't happen)

if you tried with normal configure type : su -c "make uninstall" to be sure to remove all file previously installed

check your $KDEDIR var (making echo $KDEDIR)
if nothing print try
kde-config --prefix
and set $KDEDIR to the returned value

then type

./configure --prefix=$KDEDIR
make 
su -c "make install"

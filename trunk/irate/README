INTRODUCTION

This directory contains iRATE radio client and server code. iRATE radio client
and server are free software. See the file COPYING for copying permission.

General information and the latest updates or iRATE can be found on the

IRATE VERSIONS

There are two versions of the iRATE client. Each uses a different GUI library.
One uses the Eclipse SWT library and the other uses Sun's Swing library.

The Swing version works on all platforms but can't be compiled natively. It
depends on Sun's Swing library which does not meet the DFSG (Debian Free
Software Guidelines) requirements of being free.

The SWT version works on Windows, Linux using Motif widgets and Linux using
GTK2 widgets, as well as Mac OS X using Aqua widgets. The SWT library itself
is free software but both Windows and Motif are non-free. Therefore the the
GTK2 version of iRATE is recommended if it is supported on your platform.


BUILDING WITH JAVA SDK

To compile iRATE to run under the java VM you will need the Java SDK v1.4 or 
equivalent and Apache Ant 1.5.2.

http://ant.apache.org/

Unzip the appropriate SWT version inside the lib directory platform. Then
run ant. There is no separate build to compile only the Swing version at
the moment.

$ ant

To run the SWT version on a *nix platform you need to do this:

$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=lib
$ java -jar irate-client-swt.jar

To run the SWT version on any platform you need to do:

$ java -Djava.library.path=lib -jar irate-client-swt.jar

To run the Swing version you will need to do this:

$ java -jar irate-client-swing.jar

To run the Swing version on any platform you need to do:

$ java -Djava.library.path=lib -jar irate-client-swing.jar


Due to threading oddities with Apple's Java runtime,the SWT build on Mac OS X
needs to be run from an application bundle:

$ ant mac

This will create an application bundle iRATE.app, which can be launched from
Finder or by "open iRATE.app".


BUILDING WITH GCJ

To build the SWT binary version you will need GCJ > 3.0.4 installed. All you
need to do is run make like this:

$ make

To run it you need to do this:

$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=lib
$ ./irate-client

Building iRATE using GCJ on Windows is not recommended. If you wish to develop
iRATE on the Windows platform then use the Java SDK (above).

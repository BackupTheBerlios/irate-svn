IRATE VERSIONS

There are two versions of the iRATE client. Each uses a different GUI library.
One uses the Eclipse SWT library and the other uses Sun's Swing library.

The Swing version works on all platforms but can't be compiled natively. It
depends on Sun's Swing library which does not meet the DFSG (Debian Free
Software Guidelines) requirements of being free.

The SWT version works on Windows, Linux using Motif widgets and Linux using
GTK2 widgets. The SWT library itself is free software but both Windows and
Motif are non-free. Therefore the the GTK2 version of iRATE is recommended
if it is supported on your platform.


BUILDING WITH JAVA SDK

To compile iRATE to run under the java VM you will need the Java SDK v1.4 or 
equivalent and Apache Ant 1.5.2.

http://ant.apache.org/

Unzip the appropriate SWT version inside the lib directory platform. Then
run ant. There is no separate build to compile only the Swing version at
the moment.

$ ant

To run the SWT version on a *nix platform you need to do this:

$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=lib
$ java -jar irate-client.jar

To run the SWT version on any platform you need to do:

$ java -Djava.library.path=lib -jar irate-client-swt.jar

To run the Swing version you will need to do this:

$ java -jar irate-swing-client.jar

To run the Swing version on any platform you need to do:

$ java -Djava.library.path=lib -jar irate-client-swing.jar


BUILDING WITH GCJ

To build the SWT binary version you will need GCJ > 3.0.4 installed. All you
need to do is run make like this:

$ make

There's a handy scrip to run it:

$ ./irate-client.sh

Building iRATE using GCJ on Windows is not recommended. If you wish to develop
iRATE on the Windows platform then use the Java SDK (above).

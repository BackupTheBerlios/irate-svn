Building snapshot RPM's for the iRATE client

Steps 1-3 need only be done once, and may not be necessary if you've built
RPM's before.

1) Install the rpm-build package.

2) Assuming that you want to build as a normal user instead of root, create
the file ~/.rpmmacros with the single line

%_topdir                /home/tppytel/RPM

The path can point to any directory which is writeable by you. You cannot use
the ~ shortcut for your home directory, however.

3) Create the necessary directories:

mkdir -p /home/tppytel/RPM/{SPECS,SOURCES,RPMS,SRPMS,BUILD}

substituting your choice of path appropriately.

4) Copy the spec file from your distro's subdirectory to RPM/SPECS. You may
want to rename it to something logical like irate.spec.

5) Copy any other files from your distro's subdirectory to RPM/SOURCES. You
cannot rename these files. (Well you *can*, of course, but then you'd have to
change the spec file as well.)

6) Create a source tarball called irate-src.tar.gz from the CVS pull and put
it in RPM/SOURCES. With my path choices, this looks like:

cd ~/cvsirate
tar czf ~/RPM/SOURCES/irate-src.tar.gz

7) cd to the SPECS directory and do: 

rpmbuild -bb irate.spec

using whatever name you chose for the spec. Note that SuSE (should I ever get
specs in for it) uses an older RPM version - use "rpm -bb" instead of
"rpmbuild -bb".

8) You will find the new RPM in either the i386 or i586 subdirectory of 
RPM/RPMS - which one depends on the distro.

*** Mandrake 9.1 README ***

The iRATE client depends upon libswt-gtk2. A package can be found at

http://www.sophrosune.org/irate/mdk91

Note that the iRATE package on that page is the stable version. If you're
building from these CVS materials, you don't want the iRATE package from 
there, only the libswt-gtk2 package.

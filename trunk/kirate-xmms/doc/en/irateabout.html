This program allow you to use iRate Radio track selection of freely downloadable music into XMMS.<br>
iRATE radio is a client-server system. A program called the iRATE client(this plugin,for exemple) downloads and plays MP3s, while the iRATE server keeps track of the relationships between users' listening preferences. The client asks the server for a list of MP3 tracks and downloads those tracks from their respective web sites:
<br><br>
To listen to iRATE Radio, individual users download the iRATE client program to to their computers. When the client is run, it contacts the iRATE server over the Internet and asks for a list of songs the user might be interested in hearing.

            </b><br>
When the user requests a track it will sends all the user's ratings to
the server and the server chooses tracks based on these ratings. The
server uses the following methods to choose the tracks:<br>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Initial</b> - when the user first joins a standard
set of tracks are downloaded.</li>
              <li><b>Correlation</b> - the user's preferences are
correlated with each other user's preferences. This correlation gives a
weighting factor for each user's ratings. A track is chosen using the
weighted average ratings.<br>
              </li>
              <li><b>Random</b> - this just chooses a completely random
track from the database. 1 time in 20. Random is also used to top up if
the other methods don't choose a track.</li>
            </ul>
The response from the server contains a list of tracks containing the
Artist, Track Name and URL for the track. The client application
downloads the track via HTTP from the given URL.<br>

            </td></tr><tr><td valign="top" bgcolor="#758CFF"><h2>Why
doesn't iRATE use genres?</h2></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
The philosophy or iRATE is to allow people to listen to music and rate
it 'without prejudice'. Users are expected to rate tracks on their own
merit based on how much they would like to listen to ehe track.<br>
            <br>
            </td></tr><tr><td valign="top" bgcolor="#758CFF"><h2>How do I
rate the tracks?</h2></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
Concentrate on your local play list and let the server do it's thing.
Rate the tracks based on what you want to hear. Don't try to second
guess the server because the server algorithm may change from time to
time.<br>

should I do about bugs or feature requests?</h2></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
	    If your request go to irate go to irate <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=77232&amp;atid=549602">feature
request</a> system. First check if your feature is already in
the database, if not then feel free to add it.

<br /> If it's a bug or a feature request for this plugin feel free to write me an email at <a href="mailto:matthias.studer@ezwww.ch">matthias.studer@ezwww.ch</a>.

You have to rate tracks for it to be able to find music that you like.
It may take a while before it figures out the users with the closest
tastes to you. It will always give you some randomly selected music so
that the system can get ratings for new tracks. If you've downloaded a
lot of music then you may run out of recommendations and therefore get
random selections.<br>

            </td></tr><tr><td valign="top" bgcolor="#758CFF"><h2>Where does
the music come from?</h2></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
A bunch of web sites host tracks and make them available for http
download. Anything I can find on the Internet which appears to be a
ligitimate site offering free downloads.<br>
            <br>
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" bgcolor="#758CFF"><h2>Are the
artists getting ripped off?</h2></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
No. The artists have chosen to make their music available. Record
companies have to pay to get music onto the radio and iRATE performs
the
same function as radio, if you like their music then perhaps you'll buy
the album or go to their concert.<br>

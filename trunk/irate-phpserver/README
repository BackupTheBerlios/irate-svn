What is this ? => iRATE PHP server v0.1 "Simonika"

Which license ? => GPL licensed, baby

Who wrote it ? => PeerMajor.org (nice place for free music)



***
Intro
**************************

This is an iRATE server written in PHP.

It implements a new HTTP protocol for iRATE, as well as new
SQL backend.




*********
Installation
***************************************

You basically need an Apache+PHP server, and some SQL database.

Currently, we only tested it with MySQL, but it should work
with other databases as well.

You need to create a database, and import the database scheme in 
the file setup.sql. To do so, you have to do somethin like :

irate-phpserver/# mysql -u root -p
password:
> create database irate;
> use irate;
> source setup.sql;
> exit;


Then edit config.php, and fix the DSN with your database password.

You need to put your irate-phpserver somewhere in your apache webroot.
Additionally, you should have an apache vhost linked to the
irate-phpserver directory, so that the URL of the server is simple.


Then log in as admin to create the admin account.

Quick FAQ
*************************

 - A server written in PHP ? WTF ?!

We'll most likely end up rewritting this code in C/C++ in the next
few years, but for the moment, writting it in PHP makes sense, 
maybe more for Apache than for PHP. Performance issues will be
mostly SQL related, and Apache will help with scalability. We also
would like many people to test new correlation algorithms, and
PHP is very easy to learn and use, and most of the hard stuff
will be SQL-related.

 - Why a new HTTP protocol ?

To allow people behind a firewall to use iRATE.





**********
The Protocol
*************************

Actually communicating with the iRATE server is very easy :
it can be done with a web browser for testing purposes, and
with any HTTP library for your third-party apps.

The variables can be sent in GET or POST mode (POST is better
for long ones)

The server replies with XML data.


Here are the main things you can do with irate-phpserver :

* Logging in
------------

 GET http://irate.server.org/?u=myuser&p=mypass

"u=myuser&p=mypass" : The client connects with login/pass : myuser/mypass.
 If the user "myuser" doesn't exists, it'll be automatically created
 with the given password.

 After the first login, the client can only send a hash of this password
 to the server.
 
 The Holly hash is : SHA1("irate".$password); Great, moo ?

 So now we get "?u=myuser&h=HASH" instead of "?u=myuser&p=mypass"


* Asking for new tracks
-----------------------

 GET http://../?u=myuser&h=HASH&do=getnew&n=5

"do=getnew&n=5" : The client asks for 5 new tracks to rate.


Server replies :
 (HTTP Headers)
 
 <tracks>
  <track>
  <id>XXXX</id>
  <artistname>XXXX</artistname>
  <albumname>XXXX</albumname>
  ...
  <distributions>
   <distribution>
    <hash_sha1>SHA1</hash_sha1>
    <codec>VORBIS</codec>
    <averagebitrate>128</averagebitrate>
    <crediturl>http://www.magnatune.com/artists/XXXX</crediturl>
    ...
    <sources>
     <source>
      <protocol>http</protocol>
      <link>http://../XXX.mp3</link>
      ...
     </source>
     ...
    </sources>
   </distribution>
   ...
  <distributions>
 </track>
 ...
</tracks>


So we have 3 hierarchical things : track, distribution and source.

- Fields for a track

* id : 

This is a custom LDBID (http://www.libredb.org/).

iRATE servers can have two kinds of files. The ones that come
from LibreDB, and the other, server-specific ones.

For LibreDB files, The ID will be [LDBID]-0

For the others, the ID will be XXXXXXX-YYY-ZZ-1 (same scheme
as LDBIDs, but it's the irate server admin who gives
these IDs.)

* artistname : string
* albumname : string
* trackname : string
* duration : int (length in seconds)
* license
* crediturl : string

- Fields for a distribution

* crediturl : string
* codec : string (http://www.matroska.org/technical/specs/codecid/)
* averagebitrate : int (indicative)
* hash_sha1 : string(40)
* filesize : int

- Fields for a source

* protocol : string (eg. "http" or "bittorrent" or whatever)
* link : string
* crediturl : string


The shown crediturl should be the first available from source, distribution and then track.


* Rating tracks
---------------

 GET http://../?u=myuser&h=HASH&do=rate&rate=XX:6,YY:9

"do=rate&t=99:6,33:9" : Rate the tracks XX and YY to 6/10 and 9/10 

 Replace XX and YY by track IDs like 1043-001-34-0


* Getting all the ratings back to the client
--------------------------------------------

Client : GET http://../&u=myuser&h=HASH&do=getratings

"do=getratings" : the client asks for its previous ratings

Server replies : 
(HTTP Headers)

<ratings>XX:6,YY:3</ratings>

The client had previously done 2 ratings : it rated the track with ID XX to 6/10, and the track YY to 3/10


* Errors
--------

At any time, the server can return an error like this :

Server reply :

<error>ERROR_CODE</error>

The error codes can be :
* WRONG_PASSWORD : The password doesn't match for the user.
* MUST_LOGIN : The username or the password wasn't given



* Admin actions
---------------

The user named "admin" is the admin of the server (not kidding)

You must set a password for this user when setting up your
server, logging in with "?u=admin&p=new_admin_password", at
the very beginning.

Then what you can do is :

 - Grab all new tracks from LibreDB :
   "?u=admin&p=...&do=admin&action=grab&grab=libredb_audio1"




* Migrating from old irate (dev only !)
---------------------------------------

Get a track ID from a http url :
 - "?u=..&p=..&do=OLD_url2id&url=http://artist.iuma.com/..."

Migration steps :

 1. server: Import user database
 2. server: Export all tracks to libredb and them import them from libredb to irate (they have IDs now)
 3. client: Make the new client ask for IDs. (see above)
 4. client: Make the client send again all his ratings with
 appropriate IDs
 5. client: Move files,database,... to the new scheme

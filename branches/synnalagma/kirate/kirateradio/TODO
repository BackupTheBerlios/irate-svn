What's missing and ideas:
(8)	- Playlist length unused (all songs (not broken) rated better than This Sux displayed). (The problem is I
		don't know how to choose songs to display or not)

////////////This is partialy done most of it.
(7)	- missing retry code in case of error (like checking retry depending on wich error appeared)
		Some errors that must be checked :
			Connection closed by server (this is typically an error that is recoverable)
			Connection lost (Like the timeout)
			Unable to reach server (usually server are valid we can pretend this)
		////////////////////Not done
		Maybe check that at least one connection was successfull before marking song as broken
		Maybe pick random broken song in database to check if it's actually valid
			This must be done only if the error wasn't "File doesn't exist"
			Maybe do this by adding a file error.xml ?
			
///////////////For help wait till non-programmer use it
(2)	- HELP about the program (quite important actually).

//////////////Same as above actually displacing the dir is sufficient
(5)	- configure iRate dir in Configuration Dialog.
//////////////Like the idea 
(4)	- code for exporting songs to friends and importing (Cool but not for now)
//////////////Quick Fixed
(5)	- Undo for rating (quick fixed actually by leaving the song till next This Sux rating).
(4)	- Check for existing link and show it in info box (artists.iuma can be guessed the same for magnatune)
//////////////Later
(7)	- Manage the autodownload count (find where it's actually usefull)
//////////////
(4)	- Themed info box (quick to do)
//////////////Job on the site
(9)	- Add Text about majors/music politics and so on that can be i18n'd
		- excellent artist experience and political position from aredje.net to include
(7)	- Document code if someone else want to contribute
//////////////////Done
(10)	- unload crash (quite anoying to do)

Already done:
	- Rating
	- Configuration Dialog
	- Popup for Unrated song (see screenshot)
	- Multiple file download (you can set how much) at a same time
	- Disable/enable internet connexion
	- Only download one file at a time from a specific server
	- Resuming of download
	- New account creation (screenshot http://hacker.nabix.net/noatun/noatuncreateaccount.png)
	- Retry a download (on connexion lost and timeout,etc...)
	- Almost all is i18n compatible (thought no translation done)
	- GZip compression in communication with server
	- About
	- Configurable song selection algorythm (like play only songs with rating higher than, set weight of unrated songs, care about how many time a song has been played or not, use squared rating)
	- Configurable display (actually just font)
	- Export songs as m3u playlist with URL (for sharing with friends) or local filename. Export is based on rating.
	- irate folder is now configurable at account creation
